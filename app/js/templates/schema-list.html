<h1>Schema List</h1>

<table class="schema-list">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>View</th>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody></tbody>
</table>

<small><strong>Note: </strong>The schema is generated based on the view name.
    Eg: to generate a schema for a view `pdp`, we'll need a fixture named
    `pdp.html` in the tests/fixtures/ directory.

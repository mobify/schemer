Schemer
=======

Schema comparison tool for Adaptive.js projects.

## What's a schema?
A schema's the saved context values for an Adaptive.js view. This represents the
state of a saved fixture (essentially the saved page the view is intended for),
when the view is applied to it.

## What does this tool do?
It allows you to compare the saved schema against the current version, and 
highlights any variations, surfacing unintended changes to the schema.

h3 Implicit variable declaration

p This module provides support for omitting the var keyword: the variables will be automagically defined in the closest relevant closure.

h4 Examples

textarea
  x = 1, a = 3
  -> {
    x = 2
    y = 2
  }

p The var will be pulled to the top of the current closure:
textarea
  -> {
    x = 2
    var x
  }

h4 Explicit assigment with var

p Itâ€™s possible to explicity declare a variable to a function scope if you donâ€™t want to trample over a variable in outer scope:

textarea
  state = "running"
  run = -> {
    var state = {}
  }
  run()
